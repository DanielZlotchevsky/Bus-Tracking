# Boston Line 15 Bus Tracker

## Description
This program uses two seperate APIs, MapBox and MTBA, to generate a map of boston and place marker, and to get data of both buses and bus stops to plug into the map. This program tracks the location of all Route 15 buses and stops in particular.

## Usage
After loading this program onto your machine, you can either follow the API documentation found at https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/, or if you are looking to track vehicles and stops in the same general location, you can replace the URLs at the bottom of the JavaScript file to suit your needs.

## Potential Future Updates
A couple of improvements I will be looking to make are to add a GPS feature or to add arrival times if a specific bus stop is clicked.
